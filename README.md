Playing with traveling salesman problem in the form of Boston Tot Spray locations

See the [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/mnksmith/TotSprays/blob/main/Tot_Spray_Two-Opt.ipynb) on Two-Opt for a detailed walk-through of the thought process and approximate solution. Because of the way the traveling salesman problem scales with N!, approximate is the best we can do for lists as long as ~50. The other notebook is an undocumented sandbox without markdown, playing with brute force and other exact solutions.

Find the location data in the data folder and some example output routes in the maps folder.
