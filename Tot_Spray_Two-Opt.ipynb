    "# Route Optimization for Boston Tot Sprays\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Parks department wants to be able to regularly visit each tot spray to check if it is clean and fully functional. Please provide an algorithm that would optimize the total travel time between all the tot sprays. It does not have to be the shortest route, but rather an algorithm that would produce an ordered list of the various locations for the driver to visit that would cut down the time compared to them guessing the best route themselves.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of visiting each Boston tot spray in minimum time is an application of the infamous \"Traveling Salesman Problem\".  The Parks department needs to visit each tot spray once, in succession, until all locations have been hit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The route optimization here presented is not an exact solution to the problem, but rather an iterative approach that can be used to improve a given route.  Alternative algorithms and the thought process behind my selection can be found toward the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tot spray is a *node*, the path linking each node an *edge*, and each route used to visit all of them a *tour*.  Each node is connected to every other node by an edge, which carries a *weight* given by the distance between the nodes.  The goal is to choose the optimal sequence of edges to make up the shortest tour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 2-Opt Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea behind an iterative approach to optimization is to make a small change and see if the result improves.  For our purposes this means that we start with a randomly chosen route, alter the route slightly, and determine if we get a shorter tour length.  If so, we remember the better tour, do another route alteration, rinse and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2-opt algorithm chooses an edge and reverses its direction.  (This is the same as choosing two nodes and swapping them).  If the reversal improves the tour length, it's kept, if not, the original tour is kept.  This process is repeated by looping over pairs of nodes until all pairs have been considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "A => B => C => D becomes A => C => B => D, if ABCD > ACBD <br>\n",
    "A => C => B => D becomes A => C => D => B, if ACBD > ACDB <br>\n",
    "And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of 2-opt is to \"untangle\" crossing routes over time.  With many iterations the route becomes smoother and smoother, optimizing the tour length.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Preparation\n",

    "Import libraries and dataset.  I used random sampling on a smaller number of nodes for troubleshooting.  I add an entry to the dataframe to include City Hall."

    "### Exact Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brute Force\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial naive idea when considering this route optimization problem would be to find the exact solution via brute force.  This would involve running every single possible route and saving the shortest one.  The problem is that the number of possible routes given $ N $ nodes goes with $ O(N!) $, meaning that for 50 tot sprays we'd have to consider an infeasible $ >10^{60} $ routes.  For 7 or 8 nodes, brute force might be worth a try but for this problem it's a no-go.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branch and Bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option for producing an exact solution is the Branch and Bound (BnB) method.  This method sets a minimum bound on the possible shortest route.  As the algorithm progresses through the nodes, the minimum bound is continuously updated as the route gets closer to the end.  Once the end is reached, the route is saved as the best route so far and the algorithm starts again.  Now the next node is only chosen if the minimum bound is less than the best route, otherwise that node and all nodes that come after it are pruned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal case, the BnB algorithm can significantly reduce the number of routes considered, so I tried implementing it for the tot spray data and still found it too computationally taxing (code available upon request).  I concluded that an exact solution was out of reach for the time being and went on to try approximation algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximation Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nearest-Neighbor\n",
    "\n",
    "On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Nearest-Neighbor, or \"greedy\", algorithm.  This is a common sense approach in which the driver would start at City Hall, pick the closest tot spray and drive to it.  Then she would pick the closest tot spray to *that* location and drive there next, and so on.  At each node, she picks the nearest non-visited node.  The NN algorithm is quick to implement and can effectively provide an immediate route improvement, but is not the strongest alternative.  It is possible to construct a set of nodes for which NN will give the *worst* route (although that arrangement might be pretty odd).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3-opt or k-opt\n",
    "\n",
    "If 2-opt, why not 3-opt, or more!  Another possibility to further optimize the route would be to improve the pairwise swapping algorithm presented here by cutting and swapping 2 or more edges, rather than just 1.  The algorithm generates all possible edge combinations for each tour, loops over them, and checks if the tour length improves.  The underlying principle is the same as 2-opt, but the logic is more complex: for 3-opt, each edge swap has four possible route alterations.  Given that complexity, a complete 3-opt algorithm also takes longer to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the 2-opt algorithm because the logic is straightforward, the runtime on 50 nodes was manageable, and the output produced a clear route improvement."
